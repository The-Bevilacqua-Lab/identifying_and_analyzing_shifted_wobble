There is extra mesh next to the G(N7) and G(O6) of the GU wobble without any modeled water oxygens or metal ions. This 
extra mesh can be more clearly visualized by looking at the mesh_1.00_GU_carve_4 object in the PyMOL session.

The mesh in panels A and B were contoured at 1.00 e/A<sup>3</sup>. This is higher than the author recommended contour 
level of 0.02 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the density.
