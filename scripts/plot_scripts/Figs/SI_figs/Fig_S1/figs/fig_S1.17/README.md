Due to the presence of density, it is possible that there is an ion or water near the sugar edge of the U that was not 
included with the model.

The mesh in panels A and B were contoured at 0.10 e/A<sup>3</sup> (see 6xu8_mesh_A_0.10.png). This is higher than the 
author recommended contour level of 0.035 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the 
density.
