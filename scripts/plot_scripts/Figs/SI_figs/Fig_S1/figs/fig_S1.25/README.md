There is mesh in three areas near the GU wobble without any modeled water oxygens or metal ions. These three areas are 
next to the G(N7) and G(O6), next to the G(O6) and U(O4), and at the sugar edge of the G. This extra mesh can be more 
clearly visualized by looking at the mesh_0.08_GU_carve_4 object in the PyMOL session.
