It is possible that there is extra density at the sugar edge of the U without any modeled water oxygen or metal ion. In 
general, the density around the GU wobble is a bit poor which makes it difficult to clearly visualize.

The mesh in panel B was contoured at 0.04 e/A<sup>3</sup> (see 6wqn_mesh_B_0.04.png). This is higher than the 
author recommended contour level of 0.02 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the 
density.
