There are two regions of extra mesh in the major groove near G(N7) and near G(O6) and U(O4). It is possible that there 
are water oxygens or metal ions here that were not included with the model. This extra mesh can be more clearly 
visualized by looking at the mesh_0.08_GU_carve_3 object in the PyMOL session.

The mesh in panels A and B were contoured at 0.08 e/A<sup>3</sup>. This is different from the author recommended contour 
level of 0.07 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the density.
