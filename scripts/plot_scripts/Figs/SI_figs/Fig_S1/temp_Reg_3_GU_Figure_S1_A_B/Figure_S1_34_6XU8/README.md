The mesh in panels A and B were contoured at 0.100 e/A<sup>3</sup>. This is different from the author recommended 
contour level of 0.035 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the density. 

I do not pay as much attention to panel B for extra mesh as I do to panel A. However, I did notice here, in the panel B 
image, that there is extra mesh at the major and minor grooves of the GU wobble.
