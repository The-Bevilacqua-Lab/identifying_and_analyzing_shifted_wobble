There are five modeled water oxygens and a Na+ near the GU wobble. At one sigma, there is just a little mesh near two 
of the oxygens, no mesh around the other three oxygens, and no mesh around the Na+. At 1/2 sigma, the mesh near the two 
oxygens increases, and a substantial area of mesh appears near one other oxygen and the Na+.
