An amino acid backbone imide is donating an H-bond to the O2 of the U.

The mesh in panel B was contoured at 0.09 e/A<sup>3</sup> (see 7qca_mesh_B_0.09.png). This is higher than the 
author recommended contour level of 0.05356 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the 
density.
