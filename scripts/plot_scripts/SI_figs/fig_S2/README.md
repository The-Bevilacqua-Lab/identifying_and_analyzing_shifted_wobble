## Contents
- Correlation coeffecient between electron density map and modeled structure for the 35 structures containing 41 shifted wobbles identified in this study
- These files can be either in .txt format (if the structure is solved by cryo-EM) or .csv format (if the structure is solved by X-ray diffraction)

## Steps
- Electron density map file were downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/)
- Structure files need to be prepared by removing any modified residues to make them compatible for Phenix.
- Map-model cc files will be generated by comparing the structure files and the electron density map files. 
- The map-model cc files will be prepared after executing 'step_11_prepare_structure_files.py' and before executing 'step_12_analyze_map_model_cc.py'
