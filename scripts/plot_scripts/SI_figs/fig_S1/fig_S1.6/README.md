For other crystal structures, I've been using the 2fo-fc validation file from the RCSB PDB to generate the electron 
density map file. A 2fo-fc validation file is not provided for this structure. With the aim of generating the electron 
density map file using another method, I was looking into performing a restrained refinement using the structure factor 
file and the mmCIF file containing the model coordinates. Some of the resources that I was considering are included in 
the map_generation folder. While I was looking into this, Sharear informed me that he was able to create an electron 
density map file using Phenix (see 4u3n-sf_fcalc.ccp4). Therefore, I am going to use the file that he has provided and 
will abandon my own attempt to create this file.
