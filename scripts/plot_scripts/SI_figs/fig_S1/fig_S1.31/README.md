There is extra mesh next to the G(N7) and G(O6) of the GU wobble and next to the sugar edge of the U without any 
modeled water oxygens or metal ions. This extra mesh can be more clearly visualized by looking at the 
mesh_0.020_GU_carve_3 object in the PyMOL session.

The mesh in panels A and B were contoured at 0.020 e/A<sup>3</sup>. This is higher than the author recommended contour 
level of 0.017 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the density.
