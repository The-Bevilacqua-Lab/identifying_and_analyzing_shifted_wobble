The density around the GU wobble is quite poor for this structure.

The mesh in panel B was contoured at 0.04 e/A<sup>3</sup> (see 6ha1_mesh_B_0.04.png). This is higher than the 
author recommended contour level of 0.03 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the 
density.
