There is extra mesh in the major groove near the G(O6) and U(O4). It is possible that there is a metal ion here that 
was not included with the model. There is also some extra mesh near G(N7); however, this appears to just be due to 
this part of the guanine being close to the 5' neighboring cytosine that it is stacked with.

The mesh in panel B was contoured at 0.24 e/A<sup>3</sup> (see 7m4y_mesh_B_0.24.png). This is different from the author 
recommended contour level of 0.17 e/A<sup>3</sup> and was done to more clearly see how the model fits the density.
