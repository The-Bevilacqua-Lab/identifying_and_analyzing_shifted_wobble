It appears that there is extra mesh extending towards the sugar edge of the U; however, I think this is just from the 
nucleobase atoms rather than from any missing water oxygens or metal ions. This extra mesh can be more clearly 
visualized by looking at the mesh_3.6_GU_carve_3 object in the PyMOL session.
